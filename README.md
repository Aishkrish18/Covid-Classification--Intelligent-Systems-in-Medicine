Covid classification from lung XRay images using Machine Learning methods
The objective was to implement an image-based assistance system to detect and differentiate Covid-19 in X-Ray images. Performed classification using classical feature extraction and neural networks for three different diseases and healthy patients based on chest X-Ray images. Using ResNet101, achieved an accuracy of 94% on a noisy test set of Lung X-Rays in phase 2 with deep learning methods. Worked as a team of 4.
